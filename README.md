# Course 150 Project

I thought it would be amusing to put this code online.

I wrote it in 1992 as part of a computing module in my Biology degree.

The comments say that I completed it on 19th May 1992.

The programme provides a simple user interface to explore how restriction enzymes 
cut up DNA into smaller segments. The enzyomes look for a sequence of base pairs 
and then make a cut.

So its all just string manipulation.

It's written in Pascal.

* `PROJECT10.PAS` -- the actual application
* `ENZFILE.PAS` -- creates the data file used to list the restriction enzymes
* `TEXTPROG.PAS` -- create the text files used to provide the user help
* `*.DAT` -- data files used in the application
