*********************DNA MUTATION EXPERIMENTS***********************************                       ---INSTRUCTIONS---

The DNA mutation option in this program allows the user to subject a DNA
strand to the effects of an unspecified mutagen.The effects of the mutagen
are left up to the choice of the user :-

  1 : DELETION       of a single base in the strand ;
  2 : DUPLICATION    of a single base in the strand ;
  3 : TRANSLOCATION  of a 3 base sequence within the strand ;
  4 : INVERSION     of a 3 base sequence in the strand ;


The mutant strand generated  can then be manipulated in a similiar way to the
DNA strand already input (transcription , etc ).

N.B. When the DNA strand is mutated then if there is already a mutant strand
     in memory the this will be overwritten .
