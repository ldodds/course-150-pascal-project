********************RESTRICTION ENZYME EXPERIMENT**************************

                      ----INSTRUCTIONS----

   The restriction enzyme experiment feature in this program allows you ,
(the user) to subject DNA sequences to attack by restriction enzymes.The
program contains a list of 14 different enzymes , including the name of the
organism from which it is derived.

   On calling up the option from the menu (option 5 ), the computer will
display the list of enzymes and ask which is your choice for the restriction
experiment.Once chosen the computer will search through the DNA sequence
currently in memory (input using option 2 on the main menu) and if it finds
a part of the sequence which corresponds to the recognition site for the
chosen enzyme then it will 'cut' the DNA strand appropiately , generating
one or more fragments.
N.B. the DNA strand itself , if it contains no recognition sites,is considered
     to be a fragment.
