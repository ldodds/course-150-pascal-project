*********************TRANSCRIPTION AND TRANSLATION*************************

                        ---INSTRUCTIONS----


   Within the cell , when a gene is activated, the DNA is uncoiled and 
copied ; forming a messenger RNA product which then leaves the nucleus and
passes into the cell : this is transcription.This program simulates this
process with a relatively simple procedure , which involves substituting
all the Thymine bases in the DNA strand in memory into Uracil.

   Once the mRNA has left the nucleus , it travels to the ribosomes where
translation occurs.This is the process of forming a protein product from
the information encoded into the mRNA strand.Each triplet of bases (a codon
) corresponds to a single amino acid.The computer is able to simulate this
and produce the polypeptide from the mRNA previously transcibed.

N.B the polypepdite chain will be given in the form of the standard 3 letter
    codes for each amino acid. e.g. Phe = Phenyalanine ,
                                    Tyr = Tyrosine , etc..
